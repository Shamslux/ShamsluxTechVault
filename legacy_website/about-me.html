                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hello! I am João, also known by my username 'Shamslux'. I am Brazilian, married, and a father of
                        a beautiful 2-year-old boy. For about 8 years, I worked as a teacher in various educational levels,
                        including high school and elementary schools in private institutions in my city. I hold a degree in
                        Portuguese and Modern Hebrew language and literature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During my experience in the field of education, I was able to develop many skills that are still
                        useful in my new professional area, including patience, teaching skills, empathy, resilience,
                        persistence, communication, and a strong desire to help others understand the concepts being taught.
                        These skills prepared me to interact with clients, stakeholders, colleagues, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In 2020, one of my best friends, a Business Intelligence specialist named Tulio Brasileiro,
                        introduced me to the field of Data, especially traditional BI. Intrigued by what he shared, and
                        prompted by some reflections on life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to reinvent
                        myself and embrace a new professional path.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This journey demanded a lot of discipline and self-study. I received some online course
                        recommendations from my friend and enrolled in them. I studied for several months and began working
                        on personal projects to test my knowledge. After realizing my progress and having already started a
                        new degree program in Database Management, I finally landed my dream internship in the Business
                        Intelligence universe in October 2021.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        After starting my internship in Business Intelligence, I had the opportunity to experience the
                        core business routines of a retail company. I worked at SPIRIT, a premium fan manufacturer.
                        Despite being an intern, I was given the chance to work as a Trainee Business Analyst. My role
                        involved collaborating with the IT team to envision the future BI project. Meanwhile, using the
                        company's ERP system, I gathered data to create relevant information through monthly reports such
                        as income statements (DREs), payroll, employee benefits, product return reports, and many others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In March 2022, I received an offer to transition from an intern to a position at a small
                        technology consulting firm, working with a client in the logistics and maritime transport sector.
                        I joined OWSE as a Trainee BI Analyst and eventually rose to the position of Junior BI Analyst II,
                        earning a total of 5 promotions in about 1.5 years of my career. That period was a great
                        professional experience, and I had the opportunity to work with a healthy variety of tools,
                        methodologies, and experiences that contributed significantly to my professional growth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Starting in June 2023, I began working as a contractor for Accenture Brazil, where I joined the
                        data engineering team on a mega-project for a major Brazilian telecom company. The project was
                        possibly one of the largest migration projects within a Hadoop environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In April 2024, I started as an Analytics Data Engineer at Raízen, a renewable energy company in Brazil, a giant in the
                        energy sector and full of innovations. I have had immense pleasure in working at Raízen and being able to, along with
                        brilliant colleagues, "redefine the future of energy." We work with wonderful people and cutting-edge technologies,
                        especially with the Azure environment, Airflow, and a lot of Python and SQL.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        As a result, these experiences allowed me to work in all phases of data projects. I am capable of
                        understanding the entire process, from gathering business requirements with clients, through data
                        transformation (ETL/ELT), handling various types of data (structured, semi-structured, or
                        unstructured), using either proper tools or code, to guiding these data through the appropriate
                        processes, resulting in valuable insights that can be displayed on dashboards to provide business
                        value.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        With my experience, I gained a deep understanding of both traditional Business Intelligence
                        methodologies and the modern ways of creating a Data Warehouse, leveraging resources like Data Lakes
                        and utilizing key Big Data tools.

                        In addition to my personal passion for English, I have been studying French and Esperanto (I am currently around A2-B1
