                    <p class="text-justify">
                        I started my career in the Data field after transitioning from Education at SPIRIT, a retailer based in Rio de Janeiro
                        that specializes in premium fans. My internship focused on creating the BI project for the company and being under the
                        guidance of the company's Business Analyst. It was a fruitful period for learning about business rules and generating
                        various reports, ranging from those involving products, product returns, product categories, to financial reports,
                        employee reports, and more. I worked with Power BI, MySQL database, and an environment in AWS. I also used Excel
                        extensively due to the lack of a robust and mature Data department, but this experience was invaluable for business
                        analysis, a type of experience not easily obtained through online courses, for example. I am grateful for the
                        opportunity at SPIRIT that launched the beginning of my career.

                            After my internship at SPIRIT, I had the opportunity to work at OWSE, a small IT consulting firm. I worked for the
                            client Login Logística, a large logistics and freight transportation company in Brazil. Together with my team, I was
                            responsible for ETL, initially using Pentaho Data Integration, and later we started using Apache Hop. I maintained Power
                            BI dashboards and worked with relational databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, etc. I participated in the
                            restructuring of the client's project, refactoring dimensions and facts, and ensuring that the new project complied with
                            BI methodology rules. I spent 1 year and 4 months at this company, and I am deeply grateful to my colleagues and upper
                            management for the opportunity. It was a period during which I received 4 promotions.

                            I left OWSE for a learning opportunity at Accenture, as I transitioned from the BI Analyst subfield to Data Engineer.
                            There, I participated in a squad that provided migration services, one of the largest migrations in the world from CDP
                            to CDI (Cloudera), involving over 10,000 ETL processes. I worked with the ETL tool Jiang ETL (JETL), Python, some
                            adjustments in Scala, Informatica PowerCenter, SQL, Hive, Impala, HDFS, and more. It was a temporary contract, and I
                            stayed for only a few months, but it was a period during which I acquired skills that would later be useful in my
                            subsequent work. Here, I send my regards to all my teammates, wonderful people with whom I still maintain regular

                            My current company, Raízen, is a milestone in my career. Firstly, because it is a giant in the Brazilian energy sector,
                            which brings me great pride as a worker and as a Brazilian. Additionally, Raízen is at the forefront of technological
                            innovations and has a robust Data maturity. I get to work with incredible people and use challenging tools,
                            methodologies, and technologies. We utilize Airflow, PySpark, dbt, and have an infrastructure that leverages AWS and
                            Azure, with a robust Data Lake, best practices, and IT governance always present, along with top-notch cybersecurity
                            practices. I feel increasingly excited at the company to study new concepts in the field, and we have monthly Tech Talks
                            featuring updates from the IT universe. I am very grateful to God for my current opportunity at this company and for the
                            brilliant and kind colleagues with whom I can contribute and learn a great deal.

                        As a freelancer, I have been providing some occasional services to Global Digital during my free time, especially on
                        weekends. It has been a fantastic experience working with the team at Global Digital, a Scottish consulting firm. The
                        manager is a calm, capable, and organized person, and the atmosphere among the team and the development process is very
                        positive. This is my first international experience, and it has also been a remarkable opportunity for professional and
                        personal growth. In the project I am involved in, I was responsible for an approach that emphasizes the application of
                        Business Intelligence methodology to the client’s project. I developed the ETL, conducted business analysis based on the
                        client's requests, and translated the business rules into the development environment and the final presentation in a
                        Power BI dashboard. I hope to continue finding other opportunities to work with this beloved team at Global Digital in
                        our partnership.
