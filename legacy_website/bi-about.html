                        This is Matthew. He owns a small supermarket. Matthew is very dedicated to his business and he has some questions after
                        participating in several entrepreneurship improvement courses. He discovered that the current world is driven by data,
                        and that is how the largest companies in the world ensure their place in the competitive business landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Now that he has been exposed to new ideas, Matthew has heard about a topic called Business Intelligence. He learned that
                        this methodology, according to what he saw in the courses, allows for answers to dilemmas that he only now realizes he
                        did not fully understand in his own business.

                        Matthew discovered that he lacks precise information and details about his business. He doesn’t know much about which
                        products sell the most, which brands perform better, and which would be worth keeping in stock. He is also unaware of
                        the trends among his consumers. He realized that his revenue, cash flow, and other financial details could be more
                        automated and accurate, far beyond what he has been trying to achieve using personal spreadsheets to monitor his
                        business.

                        Finally, Matthew hired the services of a BI Analyst. After a few meetings, Matthew explained how his business worked and
                        what he wanted to learn more about. He recalled the information and tips from the courses he had taken and the example
                        dashboards he had seen in presentations. The BI Analyst took several notes and brought some constructive questions about
                        the business. After this phase, he carried out his work, using the best tools and methodologies tailored to Matthew’s
                        business needs.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">    
                        After the agreed-upon working time, Matthew was very pleased with the final result. Now, he finally had answers to his
                        questions, and visually, he could see several charts displaying information that was previously presented in a less
                        user-friendly way through tables and more tables in various spreadsheets.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">    
                        Matthew was able to experience progress in his business by investing in building a robust data project tailored to his
                        business’s type and size (after all, it wouldn’t make sense to aim for a multinational infrastructure for a small
                        business, right?).</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">    
                        This simple step is essential in a business's journey toward data maturity. After all, no business is born
                        data-mature—it’s a process. However, over time, by analyzing the business's history, Matthew will be able to make more
                        sound and informed long-term decisions. And with further maturity, who knows? We might even see him using the services
                        of a data scientist. Why not?</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">    
                        Congratulations, Matthew! Your business will certainly soar even higher!</p>
