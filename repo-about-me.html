                    </h1>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hello! I am Jo√£o, also known by my username 'Shamslux'. I am Brazilian, married, and a father of
                        a beautiful 2-year-old
                        boy. For about 8 years, I worked as a teacher in various educational levels, including high
                        school and elementary
                        schools in private institutions in my city. I hold a degree in Portuguese and Modern Hebrew
                        language and literature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        During my experience in the field of education, I was able to develop many skills that are still useful in my new
                        professional area, including patience, teaching skills, empathy, resilience, persistence, communication, and a strong
                        desire to help others understand the concepts being taught. These skills prepared me to interact with clients,
                        stakeholders, colleagues, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In 2020, one of my best friends, a Business Intelligence specialist named Tulio Brasileiro, introduced me to the field
                        of Data, especially traditional BI. Intrigued by what he shared, and prompted by some reflections on life brought on by
                        the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to reinvent myself and embrace a new professional path.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This journey demanded a lot of discipline and self-study. I received some online course recommendations from my friend
                        and enrolled in them. I studied for several months and began working on personal projects to test my knowledge. After
                        realizing my progress and having already started a new degree program in Database Management, I finally landed my dream
                        internship in the Business Intelligence universe in October 2021.

                    <h1>
                        Who I am now?
                    </h1>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        After starting my internship in Business Intelligence, I had the opportunity to experience the core business routines of
                        a retail company. I worked at SPIRIT, a premium fan manufacturer. Despite being an intern, I was given the chance to
                        work as a Trainee Business Analyst. My role involved collaborating with the IT team to envision the future BI project.
                        Meanwhile, using the company's ERP system, I gathered data to create relevant information through monthly reports such
                        as income statements (DREs), payroll, employee benefits, product return reports, and many others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In March 2022, I received an offer to transition from an intern to a position at a small technology consulting firm,
                        working with a client in the logistics and maritime transport sector. I joined OWSE as a Trainee BI Analyst and
                        eventually rose to the position of Junior BI Analyst II, earning a total of 5 promotions in about 1.5 years of my
                        career. That period was a great professional experience, and I had the opportunity to work with a healthy variety of
                        tools, methodologies, and experiences that contributed significantly to my professional growth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Starting in June 2023, I began working as a contractor for Accenture Brazil, where I joined the data engineering team on
                        a mega-project for a major Brazilian telecom company. The project was possibly one of the largest migration projects
                        within a Hadoop environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        As a result, these experiences allowed me to work in all phases of data projects. I am capable of understanding the
                        entire process, from gathering business requirements with clients, through data transformation (ETL/ELT), handling
                        various types of data (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured), using either proper tools or code, to guiding
                        these data through the appropriate processes, resulting in valuable insights that can be displayed on dashboards to
                        provide business value.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        With my experience, I gained a deep understanding of both traditional Business Intelligence methodologies and the modern
                        ways of creating a Data Warehouse, leveraging resources like Data Lakes and utilizing key Big Data tools.
